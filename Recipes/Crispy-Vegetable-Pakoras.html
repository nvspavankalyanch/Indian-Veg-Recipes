    <p><strong>These vegetable pakoras are delicious. You'll love this recipe if you've ever had Japanese tempura-coated
            veggies. These pakoras are similar, but the spiced batter gives them a unique taste. Serve with chili sauce,
            mint yogurt sauce, or sweet and sour sauce. Try this recipe with other vegetables, such as sweet potatoes,
            broccoli, and asparagus..</strong></p>

    <h2> Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup chickpea flour</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground coriander</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground turmeric</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon chili powder</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon garam masala</li>
        <li>¾ cup water</li>
        <li>1 quart oil for deep frying</li>
        <li>½ head cauliflower florets</li>
        <li>2 medium onions, sliced into rings</li>

    </ul>

    <h2><strong>Directions</strong></h2>
    <h3><strong>Step 1</strong> </h3>
    <p>Sift chickpea flour into a medium bowl; mix in garlic, salt, coriander, turmeric, chili powder, and garam masala.
        Make a well in the center; gradually pour water into the well and mix to form a thick, smooth batter.</p>
    <h3><strong>Step 2</strong> </h3>
    <p>Heat oil in a large heavy saucepan over medium-high heat to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</p>
    <h3><strong>Step 3</strong> </h3>
    <p>While the oil is heating, dip cauliflower florets and onion rings in batter to coat.</p>
    <h3><strong>Step 4</strong> </h3>
    <p>Working in small batches, fry battered vegetables in hot oil until golden brown, about 4 to 5 minutes. Drain on
        paper towels before serving.</p>

    <h2> <strong>Editor's Note </strong></h2>
    <p>We have determined the nutritional value of oil for frying based on a retention value of 10% after cooking. The
        exact amount may vary depending on cook time and temperature, ingredient density, and the specific type of oil
        used.</p>
