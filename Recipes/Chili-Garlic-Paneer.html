    <p><strong>Homemade paneer is marinated in a spicy chili garlic marinade which adds a wonderful flavor to this
            versatile Indian cheese. Pan-frying the paneer gives it delightful texture.</strong></p>

    <p><strong>I’ve wanted to share this simple, chili garlic paneer recipe for a while, since, as I joked about in the
            video,
            people just aren’t eating enough fried cheese these days, but on a serious note, the real motivation was to
            make
            sure everyone knows about this versatile Indian cheese, and how easy it is to make yourself.
            It was fun comparing the store-bought stuff to a couple of freshly made batches, and not surprisingly we
            enjoyed the
            homemade stuff more. As you can see, the method is very simple, and I think the results will impress even
            the most
            inexperienced cheese makers. In fact, making paneer is probably easier than getting it pressed into a nice,
            thick,
            uniform piece, but that’s just a matter of practice.

    <h2> Ingredients</h2>
    <h3><strong>Paneer:</strong></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 quarts whole milk</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons plain yogurt</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons fresh lemon juice, or more as needed</li>
        <li>4 cups cold water</li>
    </ul>
    <h3><strong>Chili Garlic Marinade:</strong></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
        <li>2 to 3 tablespoons Sriracha chili sauce, or other hot chili sauce</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons plain yogurt</li>
        <li>1 lemon, juiced</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons garam masala, or curry spice powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt, or to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3><strong>Chilli GarlicPaneer:</strong></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons clarified butter or ghee</li>
        <li>8 ounces paneer cheese (or homemade using recipe supplied here)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3><strong>Yogurt Dipping Sauce:</strong></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1/3 cup plain yogurt</li>
        <li>1/4 cup finely chopped cilantro leaves</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons diced jalapeno pepper</li>
        <li>1 lime, juiced</li>
        <li>salt to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2><strong>Directions</strong></h2>
    <h3><strong>Step 1</strong> </h3>
    <p>Heat milk in a large pot on between medium and medium-high heat to 195 degrees F to 205 degrees F (90 to 9
        degrees C) until milk is almost simmering. Reduce heat to low, and stir in yogurt and 3 tablespoons lemon juice.
        Stir for about 30 seconds, and if milk isn’t separating into curds and whey, stir in another 1 to 2 tablespoons
        lemon juice.</p>
    <h3><strong>Step 2</strong> </h3>
    <p>Once curds form, turn off heat, and pour in cold water to stop the cooking process and cool mixture. Pour curds
        into a cheesecloth or a cotton towel lined colander and drain out whey. Whey can be reserved for other uses.</p>
    <h3><strong>Step 3</strong> </h3>
    <p>Let curds sit and drain for 5 to 10 minutes, before gathering up the cloth, and squeezing out excess liquid. Be
        careful to not burn yourself, as the liquid may still be very hot. Press curds between layers of cloth into a
        disc of about 2 inches high, being careful not to leave excess cloth bunched up on top, or underneath the
        cheese. Place something flat over the cheese, and place a heavy pan on top to weigh down. Leave paneer under the
        weight until very firm to the touch, 30 to 90 minutes. Wrap and refrigerate until well chilled before using.</p>
    <h3><strong>Step 4</strong> </h3>
    <p>For the chili garlic marinade combine garlic, Scriracha, yogurt. lemon juice, garam masala, and kosher salt in a
        bowl; mix until well combined.</p>
    <h3><strong>Step 5</strong> </h3>
    <p>Cut paneer into squares or rectangles about 1/4 to 1/2 inch thick, and add to the marinade, tossing well to coat
        thoroughly on both sides. Wrap and marinate paneer for at least 4 hours.</p>
    <h3><strong>Step 6</strong> </h3>
    <p>Combine yogurt, cilantro, jalapeno, lime juice, and salt for the yogurt dipping sauce in a blender; blend until
        smooth.</p>
    <h3><strong>Step 7</strong> </h3>
    <p>Melt butter in a non-stick pan over medium-high heat and pan-fry paneer until well browned, about 2 minutes per
        side. Serve immediately with dipping sauce.</p>
